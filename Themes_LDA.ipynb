        "(D)ecreasing of energy consumption and environmentally friendly energy resources are the issues in the foreground nowadays. As the electric energy consumed for the illumination is high, long-lasting and low-consumption LED (light-emitting diode) technology gets prominent. There have been made much research regarding the use of photovoltaic systems in meeting the energy demand in housing and industry. However, there is need for more research with regards to photovoltaic systems' integration with energy efficiency systems. In this study, for the environments which have different lighting levels due to daylight factor, there has been proposed a low-cost PV (photovoltaics) based and distributed sensor smart LED illuminating system and there has been acquired 72.075% more energy saving in comparison with conventional LED illuminating system.
